dt "No intro"

	p Use this page template to remove the page intro title section (when you want to set up your own). Only the page content will be displayed.

	p For standard pages, the title will be <a href="#accessibility">accessibly</a> hidden.

	p On the other hand, if you are using Beaver Builder page builder, please, <strong>do not forget</strong> to set up your custom <code>h1</code> heading, as it is being completely removed from the page HTML in this case. The same applies for pages that you <a href="#any-page-builder">set to be ready for any other page builder</a>.
