		p If you've obtained the theme from <a href="#{config.url.info}">ThemeForest (Envato Market)</a>, please make sure to unpack the downloaded ZIP package on your computer first and check if you are uploading the correct theme ZIP file (or the whole theme folder).

		p Basically, the theme installation ZIP file or folder is named with your theme slug only, so only <code>#{config.slug}</code>.

		p Do not install a whole ZIP package that contains other files such as documentation, child theme, licencing and others. Install only the file in <code>#{config.slug}-package/theme</code> folder. Otherwise you might experience <a href="https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202821510">a common installation error</a>.
