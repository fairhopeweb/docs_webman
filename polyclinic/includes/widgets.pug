	p This theme enhances some native WordPress widgets with custom functionality and/or layout and adds some new custom widgets too:


	h4 "Recent Posts" widget

	p The theme only restyles the display of the post date to special, more pleasing format. To preview this change you need to enable the <em>"Display post date?"</em> widget option.


	h4 "Staff Filter" Widget

	p The theme uses a custom Staff Filter widget to display a form to filter search results specific to a <a href="#staff">Staff post type</a>. This is very useful if you plan to integrate a "<strong>find a doctor</strong>" feature on your website.
	p You can filter Staff posts by tags, department, position and/or specialty.

	p The last widget settings you save is used to set up the display of Staff search filter form on Staff search results page.
