p The theme is compatible with <a href="#beaver-builder"><strong>Beaver Builder</strong> page builder</a> plugin. It is the <em>only</em> page builder plugin in which there is an integration for <a href="#webman-amplifier">WebMan Amplifier</a> shortcodes (the shortcodes are provided as page builder modules/elements).

p If you are using a different page builder plugin and you need to use the same presentation functionality the <a href="#{config.url.demo}">theme demo website</a> presents, you can <a href="https://github.com/webmandesign/webman-amplifier/wiki">use WebMan Amplifier shortcodes</a>.

+tip( 'Use your page builder functionality', 'h4' )
	p Note that your page builder plugin might already by capable enough and provide similar functionality/elements/modules the WebMan Amplifier shortcodes do. In that case you can simply use the appropriate page builder module instead of using shortcodes. Check your page builder plugin documentation for what elements/modules it provides.

p The theme was also tested and is working perfectly fine with other page builder plugins and should be compatible with <strong>any</strong> decently coded page builder plugin.

p To ensure layout compatibility there is a convenient <strong>"Page builder layout" metabox</strong> (<a href="https://easycaptures.com/fs/uploaded/1082/9755099284.png" title="Metabox to modify a page or post layout. Can be found in the sidebar of page or post edit screen.">preview &raquo;</a>) where you can set <a href="#custom-fields">special custom fields</a> to prepare the page or post layout for use with your page builder. As every page builder works differently, you will need to set these options to your needs. (Also, please note that when you are using Beaver Builder, this metabox is not available as the plugin works automagically without it.)

+danger( 'Can not edit demo content', 'h4' )
	p Please understand that if the theme <a href="#demo-content">demo content</a> was built with a different editor (or page builder), you will not be able to edit the imported demo pages with your page builder plugin.
