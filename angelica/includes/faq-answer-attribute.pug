		p You can set featured attribute in #[+mark( 'nav', 'Appearance', 'Customize', 'Theme Options', 'Shop', '"Featured attribute slug"' )].

		p To set up the attribute you need an attribute slug, which can be obtained from #[+mark( 'nav', 'Products', 'Attributes' )] screen (see screenshot below). The theme picks up the attribute name and uses it as a label in the attribute display.
